# uniform-sums

While running a computer simulation that involved the ratio of two random variables whose denominator was a symmetric random variable centred at zero, I observed that this fact never caused the simulation to crash. This made me curious and I discovered that this interesting numerical observation turned out to be a theorem. While this is not a fundamental discovery, it is one of many experiences that convinced me of the increasingly important role computers will play in the discovery of mathematical theorems in the future.

Another interesting lesson from this experience besides the growing importance of experimental mathematics is that random structures, in this case a random walk, are useful for analysing high-dimensional objects. To what degree this is because our intuition for high dimensional structures isn’t much better than random, I don’t yet have the answer.
